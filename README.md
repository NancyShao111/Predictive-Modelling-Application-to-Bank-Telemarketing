# Predictive-Modelling-Application-to-Bank-Telemarketing-R
From an analytics perspective, using analytic skills to help a Portuguese bank find out the right time to do their telemarketing work

This case is based around a real-world dataset about telemarketing calls made by a Portuguese
bank. The bank is interested in a predictive model because it will allow them to call the right customers at
the right times. From an analytics perspective, the primary distinguishing feature in this case is that
solving a predictive problem is directly useful to the firm

There are four parts in this project:

1.Basix Explanatory Analysis 
  
  Explored the data, checked outliers and correlation, run regression models
  
2.Predictive Modeling and Tuning
  
   Splitted the data into training & test sets, run different predictive regression models, analyzed the questions of overfitting & underfitting
   
3. Improving the Predictive Power

   Plotted the correlation between target variables and independent variables, used other predictive methods (KNN & NB classifiers) to see if the model performance    increases. 
   
4. Casualty analysis & interpretation
